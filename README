What is nxtv:
  nxtv is a collection of tools to access data from the newsgroups. The primary
  objective is to access video data directly without downloading, repairing and
  extracting.
  

Prerequisites:
  Windows:
  - Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package

    Libaries to run the code. Only required if you get the error about
    mscvr100.dll missing. You need the 32-bit version of it when you run
    the 32-bit version of nxtv, even if you are on a 64-bit system. Currently
    there is no 64-bit version of nxtv.
    
    
  - Dokan Filesystem Driver (only for nxfs.exe)
    
    http://dokan-dev.net/en/download/
    
    Driver to mount nxtv virtual filesystem (nxtv.exe) on local computer.


Configuration:
  The releases folder has example config files. The news.cfg is required/shared
  for all tools. Each tool has its own config, get what you plan to use.
  See config files for settings, setting documentation will be added there.
  
  Create a "root" folder in the application directory (can be changed, but then
  the tools need to be called with extra commandline arguments).
  

Input files:
  nzb - index of a video (avi, mkv...), dvd (iso), bluray
  nxi - nx index file (more later)
  nxr - remote/web file system (more later)


Filesystem Mode:
  Copy some nzb files to the root folder. Start nxfs.exe, a M: drive should
  appear. Each nzb will show up as a folder, enter it. For large nzbs the first
  change dir might fail because it has to verify the headers, keep trying, it
  will work and be cached for the future.
  If the video is wrapped in rar's another folder level for each rar is there.
  Inside the rar folder is the video, open it with your favorite player.
  
  Arguments:
    /l <drive> (ex. /l m), defaults to m
    /r <root> (ex. /l c:\nxfsroot), defaults to .\root
  

UPNP Server Mode:
  Similar to filesystem mode...

  Arguments:
    [-f <friendly_name>] [-p <port>] [-b] <path>
  

Known issues:
  Cant change folder
    - due to header checks there might be a delay, keep trying it will work
    
  error/message text files
    - if there is something wrong in a nzb, rar a message text file will be
      in the folder, it may contain helpful information
      
  missing header/incomplete nzbs
    - if your nzb misses just a singe part in a key file it will fail
    - if a message is not available on the server it probably cause problems,
      a read error will be generated, good players might just drop a few frames
      
  password protected rars
    - yeah, good luck with that
    

How does it work:
  I'll explain later.
  
  
Where is the source:
  I want to clean it up before releasing it.
  
  
nxfs.exe - file system driver
nxup.exe - UPNP server
